Nov 25:  have hit potential impasse.  Now need to either continue building out app as if only one category or learn more about react router and have them dynamically render the correct stuff.  
two additional stateless components will be needed - how bout a card component, one for DinoType AND Era, and another for Dinosaurs.  That will be five.
Nov 28:  All routes seem to be working well; react router names interpolated into backend URLs.  
Next step:  Incorporate CRUD

Stretch:  add a user model

Nov 29:
-Next steps:  Consolidate table using bootstrap
-Implement delete and edit steps!
-CSS:- need to fix the card situation.  


Nove 30:

CRITICAL:  Edit and Delete Dinos.  Start with Delete.  This is critical.
Second priority:  Just make it look good with bootstrap.  Then submit the thing.  


you also need form validations so they cant submit a blank form
