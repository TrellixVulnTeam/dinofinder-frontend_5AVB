Nov 25:  have hit potential impasse.  Now need to either continue building out app as if only one category or learn more about react router and have them dynamically render the correct stuff.  
two additional stateless components will be needed - how bout a card component, one for DinoType AND Era, and another for Dinosaurs.  That will be five.
Nov 28:  All routes seem to be working well; react router names interpolated into backend URLs.  
Next step:  Incorporate CRUB

Stretch:  add a user model
